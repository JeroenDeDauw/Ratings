== About ==

The Ratings extension provides a tag extension that when embedded in a page allows users to
rate different "properties" of the page. It is based on the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/mediawiki/wiki/Extension:Rating_Bar Rating Bar]
extension, and primerely adds the ability to vote on multiple properties per page.

The main reason for creating a new extension is that Rating Bar has been replaced by "W4G Rating Bar",
which is not open source, so does not allow for adding any improvements.
